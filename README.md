# Deathbringer

These programs generate a character for the Deathbringer RPG. Both these programs are commandline, text only programs, there is no fancy Windows GUI, this will not change. This is an offshoot project from a Basic program I wrote in the early 90's for making D&D characters.

 The Deathbringer RPG is availble at;

Deathbringer.bas:

I am no longer updating this code, all future updates will be done on deathbringer.py. This code differs from the rules in that it does not use point buy, but rather generates attributes randomly by rolling 4d6 and taking the best three, and using that number to determine the actual attribute ranging from -4 to +4.

Compiling:
This program was writen for Qbasic and can be compiled with QB64 or FreeBasic;

FreeBasic is available at https://www.freebasic.net/. To compile under FreeBasic, use the folowing;

fbc -lang qb deathbringer.bas -x deathbringer 

I am aware this is really bad code. I originally wrote this program back in the early 90's to roll up D&D characters. While I am capable of cleaning it up and making it into a decent program, I choose not to, I like the old school coding because it goes along with the old school feel of the Deathbringer RPG. 

Deathbringer.py:

This program does use the point buy system used in the RPG rules. I wrote this program with Python 3.11.2, it should work fine with any 3.x version, I will probably ignore the problem if it doesn't work on versions of Python other than what I am using. You will need Python to run this program, Python is free and open software, it is availble for download at Python.org. If you are not familar with Python, here is a quick guide on getting it installed in Windows. If you use Linux or Mac OS, it is already installed.

If you are completely unfamilar with Python, it is a fairly easy programing language to learn. There are many good tutorials on the internet for learning the basics of Python. Below is an hour long Youtube video that gives you pretty much everything you need to know about Python to understand how this program works so you can start modifing it for you own purposes. One of my goals here was to build a simple enough code base where even someone with no Python experience can add thier own Classes, Backgrounds or Miseries just by looking at the code and doing a bit of copy/paste and modify work. I encourage everyone to copy this program, modify it and make it your own.
